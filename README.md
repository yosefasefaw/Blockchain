# Blockchain

Introduction:

Firstly, Blockchain is a type of database meaning a collection of information which are stored electronically on a computer system.
However, Blockchain is different from the classical datatype.Its main difference is its data structure. Indeed, Blockchain groups information 
into a so-called Block.Afterwards, new information are stored in a new Block and then added to the previous one in order to form a so-called
Blockchain.
