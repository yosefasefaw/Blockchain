# Blockchain

Introduction:

Firstly, Blockchain is a type of database meaning a collection of information which are stored electronically on a computer system. However, Blockchain is different from the classical datatype.Its main difference is its data structure. Indeed, Blockchain groups information into a so-called Block.Afterwards, new informations are stored in a new Block and then added to the previous one in order to form a so-called Blockchain.

Process:

In the following files you can find "Blockchain.py". This is the file where I explain and do a blockchain.The file is organized in 4 steps 

1.Import the necessary Librairies

2.Create a Block

3.Create a Blockchain 

4.Test the Blockchain 

In between those steps, I explain multiple characteristics and features of a block and a blockchain.
